# AWS Support
AWS offers four different Support plans to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services.


## Basic Support
- Is free for all AWS customers. It includes access to whitepapers, documentation, and support communities. With Basic Support, you can also contact AWS for billing questions and service limit increases.
- With Basic Support, you have access to a limited selection of [[29-AWS Trusted Advisor]] checks. 
- Additionally, you can use the **AWS Personal Health Dashboard**, a tool that provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you.
- If your company needs support beyond the Basic level, you could consider purchasing Developer, Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, and Enterprise Support.

## Developer, Business, Entrerprise On-Ramp and Enterprise Support
- Include all the benefits of Basic Support, in addition to the ability to open an unrestricted number of technical support cases. These Support plans have pay-by-the-month pricing and require no long-term contracts.
- In general, for pricing, the Developer plan has the lowest cost, the Business and Enterprise On-Ramp plans are in the middle, and the Enterprise plan has the highest cost.

### Developer Support
- Customers in the **Developer Support** plan have access to features such as:
	- Best practice guidance.
	- Client-side diagnostic tools.
	- Building-block architecture support, which consists of guidance for how to use AWS offerings, features, and services together.
- For example, suppose that your company is exploring AWS services. You’ve heard about a few different AWS services. However, you’re unsure of how to potentially use them together to build applications that can address your company’s needs. In this scenario, the building-block architecture support that is included with the Developer Support plan could help you to identify opportunities for combining specific services and features.

### Business Support
- Production workload.
- Customers with a **Business Support** plan have access to additional features, including: 
	- Use-case guidance to identify AWS offerings, features, and services that can best support your specific needs
	- All AWS Trusted Advisor checks
	- Limited support for third-party software, such as common operating systems and application stack components
- Suppose that your company has the Business Support plan and wants to install a common third-party operating system onto your Amazon EC2 instances. You could contact AWS Support for assistance with installing, configuring, and troubleshooting the operating system. For advanced topics such as optimizing performance, using custom scripts, or resolving security issues, you may need to contact the third-party software provider directly.

### Enterprise On-Ramp Support

	- A pool of Technical Account Managers to provide proactive guidance and coordinate access to programs and AWS experts
