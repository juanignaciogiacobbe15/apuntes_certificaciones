# EC2 Instance Types
- Each EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family.
- They offer varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage and networking capacity.
- Types:
	- General purpose: Balanced resources(compute, memory, and networking resources). Can be used for a variety of diverse workloads like web service or code repositories. For applications that does not require optimization in any single resource area.
	- Compute Optimized: Ideal for compute-intensive tasks like gaming servers, high performance computing or HPC, and even scientific modeling
	- Memory Optimized: Good for memory-intensive tasks. Memory optimized instances enable you to run workloads with high memory needs and receive great performance.
	- Accelerated Computing: Are good for floating point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching, as they use hardware accelerators.
	- Storage Optimized: For Workloads that require high performance for locally stored data.
