# Client-Server Model
> In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A **server** can be services, such as [[04-Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2)]] – a type of virtual server.
- A customer makes a request, and with permissions, the server responds to that request.
- Server: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2). An EC2 instance is a virtual server.

	- For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.
