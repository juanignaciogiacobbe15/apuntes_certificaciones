# Serverless computing
- **Serverless**: Your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, **you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers**.
- **Flexibility to scale applications automatically**: Serverless computing can adjust the applications' capacity by modifying the units of consumptions, such as throughput and memory.

## AWS Lambda
- **Lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers**.
- While using AWS Lambda, **you pay only for the compute time that you consume**. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration.
