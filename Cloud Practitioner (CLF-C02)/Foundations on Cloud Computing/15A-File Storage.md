# File Storage
- Multiple clients can access data that is stored in shared file folders.
- A storage server uses block storage with a local file system to organize files. Clients access data through file paths.
- File storage is ideal for use cases in which a large number of services and resources need to access the same data at the same time.
- [[15B-Amazon Elastic File System(EFS)]] is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
