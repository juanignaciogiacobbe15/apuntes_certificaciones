# Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS)
- Enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.
- Is a managed service that automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. 
- With these capabilities, you can spend less time completing administrative tasks and more time using data to innovate your applications. 
- You can integrate Amazon RDS with other services to fulfill your business and operational needs, such as using AWS Lambda to query your database from a serverless application.

## Amazon RDS database engines
- Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O). Supported database engines include:
	- Amazon Aurora
	- PostgreSQL
	- MySQL
	- MariaDB
	- Oracle Database
	- Microsoft SQL Server

# Amazon Aurora
- Is an enterprise-class relational database. It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases. It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and up to three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.
- Amazon Aurora helps to reduce your database costs by reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations, while ensuring that your database resources remain reliable and available.
- Consider Amazon Aurora if your workloads require high availability. It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.
