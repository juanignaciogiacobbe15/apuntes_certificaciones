# Relational Databases
- Data is stored in a way that relates it to other pieces of data.
- Relational databases use **structured query language (SQL)** to store and query data. This approach allows data to be stored in an easily understandable, consistent, and scalable way.
- [[16B-Amazon Relational Database Service(RDS)]] Enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.
