# Nonrelational Databases
- In a **nonrelational database**, you create tables. 
- **Table**: Place where you can store and query data.
- Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases” because they **use structures other than rows and columns to organize data**. One type of structural approach for nonrelational databases is **key-value** pairs. 
- With key-value pairs, data is organized into items (keys), and items have attributes (values). You can think of attributes as being different features of your data.
- In a key-value database, you can add or remove attributes from items in the table at any time.
- [[17B-Amazon DynamoDB]] provides a NoSQL Database service.
