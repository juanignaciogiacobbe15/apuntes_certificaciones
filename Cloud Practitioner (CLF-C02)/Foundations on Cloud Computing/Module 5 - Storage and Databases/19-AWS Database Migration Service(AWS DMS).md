# AWS Database Migration Service(AWS DMS)
- **Enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores**.
- You move data between a source database and a target database. The source and target databases can be of the same type or different types. 
- **During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database**.
- **Development and test database migrations**: Enables developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users.
- **Database consolidation**: Combining several databases into a single database.
- **Continuous replication**: Sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration.
