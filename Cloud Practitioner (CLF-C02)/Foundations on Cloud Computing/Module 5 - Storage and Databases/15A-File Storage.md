# File Storage
- **Multiple clients can access data that is stored in shared file folders**.
- A storage server uses block storage with a local file system to organize files. Clients access data through file paths.
- File storage is **ideal for use cases in which a large number of services and resources need to access the same data at the same time**.
- [15B-Amazon Elastic File System(EFS)](15B-Amazon%20Elastic%20File%20System(EFS).md) is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
