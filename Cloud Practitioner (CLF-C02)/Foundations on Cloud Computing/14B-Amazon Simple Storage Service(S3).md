# Amazon Simple Storage Service(S3)
- Provides object-level storage. S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
- When you upload a file to Amazon S3, you can set permissions to control visibility and access to it. You can also use the Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to your objects over time.

## Amazon S3 Storage Classes
- You only pay for what you use.
- When selecting an Amazon S3 storage class, consider these two factors:
	- How often you plan to retrieve your data.
	- How available you need your data to be.

### S3 Standard
- Designed for frequently accessed data
- Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones
- Provides high availability for objects. This makes it a good choice for a wide range of use cases, such as websites, content distribution, and data analytics. Amazon S3 Standard has a higher cost than other storage classes intended for infrequently accessed data and archival storage.

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access(S3 Standard-IA)
- Ideal for infrequently accessed data
- Similar to Amazon S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price
- Ideal for data infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed. Both Amazon S3 Standard and Amazon S3 Standard-IA store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones. Amazon S3 Standard-IA provides the same level of availability as Amazon S3 Standard but with a lower storage price and a higher retrieval price.}
