# Innovate with AWS Services
- When examining how to use AWS services, it is important to focus on the desired outcomes. You are properly equipped to drive innovation in the cloud if you can clearly articulate the following conditions: 
	- The current state
	- The desired state
	- The problems you are trying to solve

## Categories to innovate with AWS
- Serverless applications: Applications that don’t require you to provision, maintain, or administer servers. You don’t need to worry about fault tolerance or availability. AWS handles these capabilities for you. Building your architecture with serverless applications enables your developers to focus on their core product instead of managing and operating servers.
- AI: Convert speech to text with Amazon Transcribe, discover patterns in text with Amazon Comprehend, identify potentially fraudulent online activities with Amazon Fraud Detector, build voice and text chatbots with Amazon Lex.
- ML: AWS offers Amazon SageMaker to remove the difficult work from the process and empower you to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly. You can use ML to analyze data, solve complex problems, and predict outcomes before they happen.

## Amazon Q Developer
- Amazon Q Developer is a machine learning-powered code generator that provides you with code recommendations in real time.
- As you write code, Amazon Q Developer analyzes your code and comments as you write code in your integrated development environment (IDE). Amazon Q Developer then automatically generates suggestions based on your existing code and comments.
- Additionally, Amazon Q Developer analyzes the surrounding code, ensuring the generated code matches your style, naming conventions, and seamlessly integrates into the existing context.
