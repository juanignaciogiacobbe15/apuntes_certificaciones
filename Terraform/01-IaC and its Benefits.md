# Infrastructure as Code
- Write down what you want to deploy as human readable code.
- Enables DevOps: Codification of deployment means it can be tracked in version control enabling better visibility and collaboration across teams.
- Declare your Infrastructure: Infrastructure is, for the majority of cases, written declaratively via code but can be procedural(imperative) too!
- Speed, Cost and Reduced Risk: Less human intervention during deployment means fewer chances of security flaws, superfluous resources, and more time is saved.
