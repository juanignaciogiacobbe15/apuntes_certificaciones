# Links

> [!NOTE] `ln`
> Creates a 'hard' link to a file or directory. This type of link will only work on the file system of the originating file.


> [!NOTE] `ln -s`
> Creates a symbolic 'soft' link to a file or directory. Links of this type can traverse file systems.
> Is nothing more than a shortcut back to the original file.
> If we move the original file, it will break the link.


> [!NOTE] `unlink`
> Removes a link from a file or folder.
