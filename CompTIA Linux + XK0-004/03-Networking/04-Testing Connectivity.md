# Testing Connectivity


> [!NOTE] `ping`
> This command is used to test a system's hability to communicate with another network device by sending ICMP packets across the network.


> [!NOTE] `ping6`
> Provides the same functionality as `ping`, but defaults to IPv6 packets instead.


> [!NOTE] `traceroute`
> Displays a listing of the 'hops' a packet will traverse to get to a destination. Used to verify network routing and to look for breaks in network communication.


> [!NOTE] `traceroute6`
> This is the IPv6 equivalent of the `traceroute` command.


> [!NOTE] `tracepath`
> A modern replacement for the `traceroute` command, but utilizes UDP packets instead of ICMP.


> [!NOTE] `tracepath6`
> The IPv6 equivalent of the `traceroute` command.


> [!NOTE] `netstat`
> This command is used to display network connections and their state on a system.
> Can also be used to view the routing table. Part of the 'net-tools' package since it's deprecated.


> [!NOTE] `ss`
> Socket Statistics.
> Modern equivalent of the `netstat` command. This command does not show the routing table.
